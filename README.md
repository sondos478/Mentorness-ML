Mentoress ML: Customer Churn Prediction
Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecommunications industry using machine learning. Customer churn is a critical challenge, and accurately predicting it can help companies implement targeted retention strategies.
Dataset
The project uses the Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle, which contains customer demographics, account information, and churn status.
Project Structure
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, converting data types, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing feature distributions and analyzing the relationship between features and churn status.
Model Development: Building a logistic regression model for churn prediction and evaluating its performance.
Feature Importance Analysis: Interpreting the model coefficients to identify the most influential features.
Business Insights and Applications: Discussing practical implications and strategies for customer retention.
Future Enhancements: Exploring advanced techniques and incorporating additional data sources.
